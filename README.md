- 👯 I’m looking to collaborate on works on prediction of online harmful contents, especially if it focuses on sexism/misogyny in social media platforms.
- 🤔 I’m looking for help with learning more about publishing.
- 💬 Ask me about my project.
- 📫 How to reach me: I'm omnipresent. 🤓 (Just kidding! Feel free to connect through the platforms listed above.)

Sometimes I also like to Kaggle in my spare time. Though more privately, for my self-development work. It's cool to see other people's work and learn from there too.
