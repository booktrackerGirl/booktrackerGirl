### Hi there 👋

I'm Aditi. Thank you for visiting my profile. 😊

#### I am a Computational Social Science research student, specifically working on Natural Language Processing.

I recently contributed to <b>[The Turing Way](https://the-turing-way.netlify.app/welcome)</b> across different chapters of the project. You can find my name in the [list of contributers](https://github.com/alan-turing-institute/the-turing-way#contributors) and [records](https://the-turing-way.netlify.app/afterword/contributors-record.html#aditi-dutta)!

<h2 align="left">👨🏻‍💻 About Me:</h2>

- 🔭 I’m currently working on my research on online misogyny.
- 🌱 I’m currently learning to balance between working for my research and learning cool stuffs.
- 👯 I’m looking to collaborate on works on prediction of online harmful contents, especially if it focuses on sexism/misogyny in social media platforms.
- 🤔 I’m looking for help with learning more about publishing.
- 💬 Ask me about my project.
- 📫 How to reach me: I'm omnipresent. 🤓 (Just kidding! Feel free to connect through the platforms listed above.)
- 😄 Pronouns: She/Her
- ⚡ Fun fact: I like listening to K-pop music. I enjoy playing games and doing outdoor activities (even though I'm not good at any of those 🥲). 

<h3 align="left"> Let's get connected!</h3>

I like to work with Python, especially using Jupyter notebook.<br>

Learning to use Github a bit. My contribution so far: <br>

Sometimes I also like to Kaggle in my spare time. Though more privately, for my self-development work. It's cool to see other people's work and learn from there too. I was a [grantee](https://www.kaggle.com/bipoc2021-project-showcase) at the 2021 BIPOC Grant Program, which got me intrigued to fully utilize the platform.

## 📚 Research Interests:
My research interests are: natural language processing, data science, political social science, gender politics, computational methods and social data analysis. I love working in interdisciplinary fields, and bringing out the best of all the fields involved. 

## 📝 Collaborative Interests:
I like to explore and challenge myself to work on various projects and enhance my skills from there, not just my soft skills but also transferable skills for future works. I love sharing and gaining knowledge with people, from various backgrounds and experience levels. Discussing with people about their works and mine not only helps me learn more about their works and interests, but also allows me to receive feedback from them about mine. Which is why, collaborative environment works best for me. I learn so much from people around me. 
<br>
One programme which really helped me get introduced to this was the Turing [Data Study Group](https://www.turing.ac.uk/collaborate-turing/data-study-groups) where I got to work with other researchers in line with organisations from industry, government, and the third sectors. My recent works with them are listed below: 
1. <b>DSG December 2021</b> <br> Topic: <i>Monitoring in Clinical Trials: Identifying poor performance at recruitment sites participating in clinical trial research</i> <br> Challenge Owner: <i>Medical Research Council Clinical Trials Unit (MRC CTU) at University College London</i>
2. <b>DSG December 2022</b> <br> Topic: <i>Understanding and improving transport for the user</i> <br> Challenge Owner: <i>Department for Transport (DfT)</i>
3. <b>DSG February 2023</b> <br> Topic: <i>Towards Equitable Walking and Cycling Infrastructure for All</i> <br> Challenge Owner: <i>Sustrans</i>
